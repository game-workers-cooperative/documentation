# Membership Application

## Requirements

### Demonstration of Skills

For this requirement, you can choose to provide a portfolio of your work or we can assign you a theme and you'll be expected to create a prototype, build models, draw art, write or storyboard some scenes, or otherwise create something according to your skill set based on that theme. There will be a one week time limit in place once we assign you the theme.

If you choose to create a prototype, we know that the time limit will not allow you to create a masterpiece, but we do expect you highlight your skills and be able to present the game to us. The code should be made publicly available for review and we should be provided with a link to it. Feel free to choose any engine that you are comfortable with.

Please include a description of your prototype that includes, at least, what you were trying to achieve as well as a short explanation of how you designed it and why you designed it the way you did.
