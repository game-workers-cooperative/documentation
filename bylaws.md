[DRAFT]

Section I: Organization

1.1: The name of this cooperative is lowercase games, referred to herein as “the Co-op.”

1.2: The principal office of the Co-op is located in Rock County at such updated address as is on record with the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions.

Section II: Purpose

2.1: The purpose of the Co-op is to serve the needs of its Owners. Its primary focus is to operate a game studio providing high quality interactive entertainment to the community at fair prices as well as provide services for other creators to do the same.

2.2: Cooperative philosophy and values are an essential part of our enterprise; therefore in achieving its purpose:

    1.  The Co-op will adhere to the most recent following seven cooperative principles as adopted by the International Cooperative Alliance:

        Principle 1 — Voluntary and Open Ownership: Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of Ownership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination.

        Principle 2 — Democratic Owner Control: Cooperatives are democratic organizations controlled by their Owners, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Those serving as elected representatives are accountable to the Ownership. In primary cooperatives Owners have equal voting rights (one Owner, one vote) and cooperatives at other levels are also organized in a democratic manner.

        Principle 3 — Owner Economic Participation: Owners contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their cooperative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the cooperative. Owners usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of Ownership. Owners allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their cooperative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting Owners in proportion to their transactions with the cooperative; and supporting other activities approved by the Ownership.

        Principle 4 — Autonomy and Independence: Cooperatives are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by their Owners. If they enter into agreements with other organizations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their Owners and maintain their cooperative autonomy.

        Principle 5 — Education, Training and Information: Cooperatives provide education and training for their Owners, elected representatives, managers, and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their co-operatives. They inform the general public - particularly young people and opinion leaders - about the nature and benefits of cooperation.

        Principle 6 — Cooperation Among Cooperatives: Cooperatives serve their Owners most effectively and strengthen the cooperative movement by working together through local, national, regional and international structures.

        Principle 7 — Concern for Community: Cooperatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their Owners.

    2. In addition, the Co-op shall strive to:

        - Operate on a sound financial basis so as to provide for the long-term benefit of the Owners and the community;
        - Pursue growth and expansion of the business in order to better meet the needs of the Owners for goods and services; the employees for well-paid, satisfying jobs and opportunities for career development; and to improve efficiency and lower costs;
        - Manage the business in an open, sustainable manner that provides a humane work environment and encourages employee participation in and solicits employee input on the organizational best practices and strategic growth.
        - Maintain a business strategy that utilizes the opportunities and benefits of consumer cooperation;
        - Reach out to and expand services to segments of the community who are underserved or disadvantaged;
        - Foster consumer control by soliciting Owner input on a regular basis, being responsive to Owner needs, and encouraging Owner participation in the governance and activities of the Co-op;
        - Support and participate in efforts for progressive social and economic change.

3.4.1 Application
The application requirements and process will be decided by the owners and posted publicly. The application is currently viewable at https://github.com/game-workers-cooperative/documentation/blob/main/application.md. After applying, the application will be reviewed by the Owners and decisions will be made according to the process described in section 4.7.

3.4.2 Owner Equity Share
The Owner equity share is the dollar amount that is required to purchase an Ownership share. The Board of Directors may make provisions allowing the purchase of this share in installments over time and may allocate a portion of each payment as a non-refundable administrative fee. Any change to the amount of the Owner equity share shall be approved by the Owners using the signed ballot process described in Section 4.7. The Owner equity share value is currently set at $100. Payment will only be required after the applicant has completed their trial period.

3.4.3 Trial Period
After an application has been accepted, a prospective Owner will begin a trial period. This trial period will last for six months and the prospective Owner will be held to the following standards:
* Show up for at least 75% of weekly meetings. If you cannot make it to the meeting, you must watch the recording before the next meeting is held.
* Participate in discussion forums. Contribute on a relatively frequent basis (3+ days a week) to discussions relating to your role and preferably to open discussions as well.
* Meaningfully contribute to the tasks assigned to your role. Add tasks, comment on them, assign yourself to things, and usher them through the system.
* Participate in at least 75% of votes.

At the end of the trial period, the Owners will vote on accept the prospective Owner as a full Owner. If so, they will be held to the expectations listed in 3.4.4.

3.4.4 Owner Expectations
An Owner is considered to be current and in good standing if the Owner equity share is paid in full or the required installment payments have been made. Additionally, Owners will be held to the following standards:

* Show up for at least 75% of weekly meetings. If you cannot make it to the meeting, you must watch the recording before the next meeting is held.
* Participate in discussion forums. Contribute on a relatively frequent basis (4+ days a week) to discussions relating to your role and preferably to open discussions as well.

* Participate in 100% of votes.
* Provide consistent office hours. Share your hours with the rest of the members and inform everyone if they will change for any reason.

If an Owner doesn't continue to meet these standards, then the Owner will be no longer considered in good standing. At that point, the Owners will begin a formal evaluation of membership.
 
3.4.5 Payment and Compensation
Payment will be calculated based on AORTA. Patronage formula needs to be figured out here
@todo flesh out this section

    - Ballots shall be received by the time that the special meeting is called to order if they are to be counted as valid votes.
@todo revise this with polling information in other bylaws doc

Votes can be proposed by any Owner in good standing at any meeting. Owners will vote via ranked choice voting when choices are non-binary. Binary proposals will be decided through consensus voting.

Consensus is achieved if all parties vote yes or abstain from the vote. 

All consensus votes will include a block option as well. Blocking instantly ends the vote and does not achieve consensus. Blocking is to be used when an objection to the idea is serious enough that you feel allowing it to happen would harm the Co-op.

Blocked votes can be brought again after a period of at least 48 hours to allow for discussion. Blocked votes can also be scrapped entirely or revised based on discussion.

All polls will have at least a 48 hour window to accommodate all timezone issues as well as allowing time to rethink and change one's mind. Unless otherwise noted, all polls will openly display the voter's name and will be saved for reference in perpetuity.

Any and all decisions formed through consensus can be revisited for revision or removal at any time.

4.8: Petitions: Any matter that the Owners wish to put before the Ownership via a Co-op vote may be placed on the ballot in the following way:
    - If a petition signed by at least five percent (5%) of the total number of Owners in good standing is submitted, the President shall place the issue on the ballot for the next regularly scheduled Co-op vote;
    - If a petition is signed by at least 20 percent (20%) of the total number of Owners in good standing, the President shall schedule a special vote no sooner than 30 days and no later than 75 days from the date the petition is submitted in accordance with Section 185.13(3), Wisconsin Statutes.
